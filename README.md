# NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise-Predicting-Taxi-Fares-with-NVIDIA-RAPIDS (NVIDIA AI Playground)

Familiarized myself with RAPIDS GPU data frame library cuDF and how it integrates with Dask and XGBoost. Used cuDF to ingest data into the GPU and then run data cleanup. Then train an XGBoost model to predict the taxi fares in Manhattan.
